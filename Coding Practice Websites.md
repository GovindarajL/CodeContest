- [Use of Different Websites SPOJ or CodeChef or Codeforces from Quora.md](https://www.quora.com/Should-I-do-HackerRank-SPOJ-TopCoder-CodeForces-or-CodeChef)
- HackerRank - Primarily a hiring platform. If you are in your final or pre-final year, this would be the platform where most of your preliminary rounds would take place for hiring as an intern and a full time employee. Start working on the platform a couple of months before your expected applications.
SPOJ - If your basics are strong there are better chances of adapting when modified questions are asked. Classical questions on SPOJ are great once you are done with first programming course at your institute.
TopCoder - Old is Gold. Most of the great programmers have aced on this platform and it is highly recognised in the industry. Great platform for improving medium-hard to hard topics. Fairly experienced programmers will enjoy here.
CodeForces - My personal favourite. Best UI, amazing coding community and great problems. I have personally gained maximum from this platform. If you want to have an interactive engagement with competitions this is your place. It is the Quora of coding platforms.
CodeChef - No test cases are visible so you improve a lot as you have to think and debug where you go wrong. If you want a future in Direct-I or Zeta or Media.net, then make sure you have a lot of stars on your CodeChef profile.
HackerEarth - Codemonk series is a great place to start competitive programming. I would have started here if I was a beginner. Recent contests have also improved in quality.
GeeksForGeeks - This is great for cracking interviews. Nothing more, nothing less!
I loved CodeForces as a platform and as a community.

I never worked a lot on SPOJ or CodeChef because of their way too stringent time limit constraints. They timed out on the expected solutions in Java and hence were a big turn-off for me.

Regardless, I participated in all possible contests on available platforms.

Participate in all, practice on one or two!
